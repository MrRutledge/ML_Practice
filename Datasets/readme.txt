Title: A geo-coded inventory of anophelines in the Afrotropical Region south of the Sahara: 1898-2016

Short Title: Africa Vectors Database: 1898-2016

Description: Understanding the distribution of anopheline vectors of malaria is an important prelude to the design of national malaria control and elimination programmes. A single, geo-coded continental inventory of anophelines using all available published and unpublished data has not been undertaken since the 1960s. We present the largest ever geo-coded database of anophelines in Africa representing a legacy dataset for future updating and identification of knowledge gaps at national levels. The geo-coded and referenced database is made available with the related publication as a reference source for African national malaria control programmes planning their future control and elimination strategies.

3.  METHOD and PROCESSING 
--------------------------  

Data Collection and Processing: Information on data collection, organisation, sampling, species identification and survey-geo-coding are made available in the accompanying/referenced manuscript (i.e. A geo-coded inventory of anophelines in the Afrotropical Region south of the Sahara: 1898-2016) submitted to Wellcome Open Research (WOR) for publication.



4.  Software and Documentation:
